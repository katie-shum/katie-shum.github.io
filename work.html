      <p class="work-desc">Last year, I interned at a startup whose goal was to help small retail/restaurant businesses
        with their HR, insurance, and marketing. I worked on a team of 5 to create a product from ideation to execution

      <p class="position">Mobile Product Intern - Summer 2019</p>
      <p class="work-desc">At E*TRADE, I worked in an Agile environment to develop initial use cases for a Google Assistant app action
        using aspects of conversation design and design thinking. I also worked with the design team to re-engineer the trade ticket and
        education center. Lastly, I created data visualizations within Tableau to identify key mobile data
        trends for the company's Monthly Business Reviews.</p>
